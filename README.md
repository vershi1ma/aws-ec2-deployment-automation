# AWS Cloud Engineering Portfolio

## Overview
An evolving cloud engineering portfolio built while working toward a cloud/DevOps role.
It started as a single EC2 web server and has grown into a self-healing, load-balanced,
HTTPS-secured, encryption-hardened, and audit-logged web tier — with security
(IAM, KMS, CloudTrail, Secrets Manager) treated as a first-class concern throughout,
not bolted on at the end. Ongoing work extends into S3, serverless (Lambda), databases
(RDS), and cloud-agnostic tooling (Terraform, containers, CI/CD), entirely using
free-tier and free-cost resources.

## Architecture
A web tier running on Amazon Linux 2023, originally a single manually-configured
instance, later extended with a reusable Launch Template, an Auto Scaling Group
(1-3 instances across multiple Availability Zones), and an Application Load Balancer.
Traffic is served over HTTPS using a free domain and a Let's Encrypt certificate.
Access is via AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (IAM role-based, no open SSH port).
Account activity is captured via a dedicated CloudTrail trail, and data at rest (S3
objects, EBS volumes) is encrypted using customer-managed AWS KMS keys.

## Skills demonstrated
IAM · EC2 · Security Groups & Network ACLs · EBS (volumes, snapshots) · Elastic IPs ·
Bash scripting (user data) · Custom AMIs & Launch Templates · Auto Scaling Groups
(self-healing infrastructure) · Application Load Balancers & Target Groups ·
CloudWatch metrics & alarms · EC2 cost models (On-Demand vs Spot) · DNS · TLS/SSL
certificate issuance (Let's Encrypt/ACME) · Apache configuration · Linux system
administration and dependency troubleshooting · AWS KMS (customer-managed keys, envelope encryption) · S3 & EBS encryption at rest · CloudTrail (audit logging) · AWS CLI (Alpine Linux / iSH) · AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store & Secrets Manager · Amazon GuardDuty (threat detection)
